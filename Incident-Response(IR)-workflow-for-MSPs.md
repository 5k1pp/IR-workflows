# 🚀 Incident Response Playbook for MSPs using NinjaOne RMM, Datto, and ConnectWise 🔍🛡️

## **1. Introduction** 📖🛠️🛡️
This playbook provides a structured **Incident Response (IR) workflow** tailored for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) using **NinjaOne RMM, Datto, ConnectWise, and similar tools**. It aligns with industry standards such as **NIST 800-61, MITRE ATT&CK, and ISO 27035**.

## **2. Incident Response Lifecycle**

### **2.1 Preparation** ⚙️✅🛡️
- **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a list of all managed client systems and tools.
- **Log Management & SIEM**: Ensure log collection from NinjaOne, ConnectWise, Datto, and endpoints.
- **Security Monitoring**: Implement detection rules for unauthorized RMM access and privilege escalation.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: Define roles for analysts, engineers, and management.
- **Communication Plan**: Establish internal and client notification procedures.
- **Access Controls**: Enforce MFA on all RMM, backup, and PSA tools.

### **2.2 Detection & Identification** 🔎⚠️🚨
- **Common Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - Unusual login attempts to RMM/PSA tools from new locations.
  - Unexpected remote executions via RMM (e.g., PowerShell, command scripts).
  - Unauthorized backup deletions in Datto.
  - New admin accounts created in ConnectWise.
  - Malware detections from Huntress/EDR tools.
- **Initial Response Actions**:
  - Review security alerts in SIEM/logging tools.
  - Verify alert legitimacy (false positives vs. real threats).
  - Identify affected systems and accounts.

### **2.3 Containment** 🚧🔒🔐
- **Short-Term**:
  - Disable compromised user accounts (ConnectWise, NinjaOne, Datto).
  - Isolate infected endpoints from the network.
  - Block malicious IPs and domains in firewall/EDR.
  - Disable affected RMM scripts and integrations.
- **Long-Term**:
  - Change credentials and enforce MFA reauthentication.
  - Patch affected systems and tools.
  - Review and remove unnecessary remote access permissions.

### **2.4 Eradication** 🛠️🧹🚫
- **Threat Removal**:
  - Run forensic analysis to determine root cause.
  - Remove malware or persistence mechanisms.
  - Investigate lateral movement and secondary infections.
- **System Hardening**:
  - Apply latest security patches to NinjaOne, ConnectWise, and Datto.
  - Reconfigure firewall rules to limit RMM tool access.
  - Implement geo-restrictions and login alerts.

### **2.5 Recovery** 🔄🖥️🔧
- **Restoration**:
  - Recover impacted systems from **Datto backups** (verify integrity before restoring).
  - Validate security controls before reconnecting to production.
  - Conduct user awareness training if phishing was involved.
- **Monitoring Post-Incident**:
  - Increase logging and alerting for affected accounts.
  - Perform 24-48 hour enhanced monitoring.

### **2.6 Lessons Learned** 📝📊🔍
- Conduct a post-incident review within 48-72 hours.
- Document gaps in detection, response, and containment.
- Update IR playbooks, rules, and response procedures.
- Train staff on updated security measures.

## **3. Specific Attack Scenarios**
### **3.1 RMM Tool Compromise (NinjaOne/ConnectWise)** 💻🚨🔓
- **Detection**: Unauthorized logins or remote commands executed via RMM.
- **Response**: Disable affected accounts, investigate logs, reauthenticate all users.

### **3.2 Ransomware Attack** 🛑💰🔑
- **Detection**: Mass file encryption, backup deletions in Datto, ransom note detected.
- **Response**: Isolate endpoints, block malicious IPs, recover from Datto backups.

### **3.3 Phishing Attack on MSP Technicians** 🎣📧⚠️
- **Detection**: Unauthorized MFA requests, compromised admin account.
- **Response**: Reset credentials, revoke session tokens, retrain users on phishing awareness.

## **4. Conclusion** 🔚📈🔒
This playbook ensures **rapid detection, containment, and mitigation** of cybersecurity incidents affecting MSPs using **NinjaOne RMM, Datto, and ConnectWise**. Regular updates and testing are essential to staying ahead of evolving threats. 🔄🔐🛡️
