# Incident Response Workflows Repository 🚨

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to the **Incident Response Workflows** repository! This project serves as a centralized collection of **incident response (IR) workflows** tailored for different IT environments, including **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)** and enterprises. Each workflow is designed to provide a structured response strategy based on best practices such as **NIST 800-61, MITRE ATT&CK, and ISO 27035**.
